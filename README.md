 Without spigot server with RaspberryJuice plugin this program won't work. You can install it from https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-installation/ and https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/raspberryjuice.22724/
 or from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FpfR96cjk7nZ_JxeVwuM3zIbcbjlbhR3?usp=sharing

 Also you need to install mcpi and pillow python libraries: https://pypi.org/project/mcpi/ , https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/

 Without spigot server with RaspberryJuice plugin this program won't work. You can install it from https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-installation/ and https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/raspberryjuice.22724

 Also you need to install mcpi and pillow python libraries: https://pypi.org/project/mcpi/ , https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/
